* Starbuck Offer Predictor
The project outline the process of using the starbuck data to process the offers
for customers

** Libraries
- xgboost

** Order of execution
The notebook should be executed in following order
- [[file:data_exploration_preprocessing.ipynb][Data Exploration]]
- [[file:data_cleaning_classification.ipynb][Data Cleaning]]
- [[file:clustering_customers.ipynb][Modeling]]

** Solution
***** Cluster and offers
| Cluster | Offer Type   |
|---------+--------------|
|       0 | Sleeping Dog |
|       1 | Discount     |
|       2 | Discount     |
|       3 | Discount     |
|       4 | Bogo         |
|       5 | Sleeping Dog |

A model that can predict the cluster of customer based on it
past transaction, we can easily then decide which offer to send to them on quick heuristics.
The model can also be retrained every 15 days on the latest customer data to
identify new customer groups and also see any change in behavior.
